ftfuzzer
--------

ftfuzzer.cc contains a target function for FreeType fuzzing.
It can be used with libFuzzer (http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)
or potentially any other similar fuzzer.

Usage:
  1. Build libfreetype.a and ftfuzzer.cc using the most recent clang compiler
     with these flags:
     -fsanitize-coverage=edge,8bit-counters # for fuzzer coverage feedback
     -fsanitize=address,signed-integer-overflow,shift  # for bug checking
  2. Link with libFuzzer (it contains main()).
  3. Run the fuzzer on some test corpus.

The exact flags and commands may vary.
There is a continuous fuzzing bot that runs ftfuzzer:
https://github.com/google/libfuzzer-bot/tree/master/freetype.
Check the bot confituration for the most current settings.

runinput.cc contains a convenience main() function to run the target function
on a set of input files. Link it with ftfuzzer.cc and libfreetype.a
and run like "./a.out my_tests_inputs/*"
